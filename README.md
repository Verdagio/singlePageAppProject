# Single Page App Project
### Authors - Daniel Verdejo, & Karle Sleith


# Project outline
In this project, we look to utilize multiple technologies to build a single page web application. The first tasks of the project we’re choosing what we wanted our single page application to do, and then choosing the technologies we would use to accomplish this. The choice of application would be a blog style entertainment website (see below). 

The technologies to be used we’re to be: AngularJS, Bootstrap, Flask via Python, HTML5 & CSS3, & MongoDB. 
To accomplish our goal we would need to research and expand upon our existing knowledge of: AngularJS,  Flask via Python, & MongoDB. To do this we would reference the related API’s, read articles, & communicate to workout problems together. 

### Setup & Installation
To be able to run the web application on your system you will need to do the following:

##### MongoDB

######Install

Go to: [Download MongoDb](https://docs.mongodb.com/)

Download & Install MongoDB 
How to, Reference: [MongoDB Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)
